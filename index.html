        <p>Gekko and dogs can have fascinating interactions, often characterized by curiosity and playfulness. While they are different species, their relationships can be quite engaging.</p>
        <p>Gekko, being a reptile, may exhibit behaviors that intrigue dogs, who are naturally curious animals. Dogs might approach a Gekko with caution, sniffing and observing its movements.</p>
        <p>In some cases, dogs may see Gekko as a potential playmate, while Gekko may prefer to stay still or hide. It's essential for pet owners to supervise interactions to ensure the safety of both animals.</p>
        <p>Understanding these relationships can help in creating a harmonious environment for both pets, allowing them to coexist peacefully.</p>
